## 🧠 What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a type of **Deep Learning model** specifically designed to process **grid-like data**, such as images.  
It automatically learns to detect patterns and features — like edges, textures, and shapes — making it highly effective for image-related tasks.

CNNs reduce images into simpler, more abstract representations that are easier for the model to process while preserving important spatial relationships.

### 1. **Input Layer**
- Receives the raw image data (pixel values).
- Example: A 28×28 grayscale image or a 224×224 RGB image.

### 2. **Feature Extraction Layers**
These are the core of a CNN:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Apply filters (kernels) to detect features like edges, lines, and corners.
- **Activation Function (ReLU):** Adds non-linearity so the network can learn complex patterns.
- **Pooling Layers (Max Pooling):** Reduce spatial size and computation while retaining key information.

### 3. **Classification Layers**
- Flatten the extracted features into a vector.
- Feed them into **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**.
- Use a **Softmax Layer** at the end to classify the image into categories.

## ⚙️ How CNNs Learn
- CNNs learn through **backpropagation** by adjusting the filter weights.
- They minimize prediction error using optimizers like **SGD** or **Adam**.
- Over time, the model becomes better at detecting the right patterns and identifying images correctly.

## 🚫 Limitations of CNNs

| Limitation | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **High Computation Cost** | Training requires large datasets and GPUs. |
| **Overfitting** | CNNs may memorize training data instead of generalizing. |
| **Interpretability** | Hard to understand *why* a CNN made a certain prediction. |
| **Sensitivity** | Small image changes (like rotation or noise) can affect accuracy. |
