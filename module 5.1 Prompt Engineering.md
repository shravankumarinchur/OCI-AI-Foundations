### 🔹 What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the process of designing effective input instructions (called *prompts*) to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT to produce the desired output.
Since LLMs don’t “know” what you want unless you clearly specify it, the way you phrase your input directly affects the quality, accuracy, and style of the response.

Think of a prompt as the **question or instruction** you give to an AI — good prompts lead to good answers.

### 🔹 Why It’s Important

Prompt engineering helps you:

* Get **accurate and relevant results**.
* Control the **tone, length, and format** of responses.
* Handle **complex tasks** like summarization, translation, coding, or reasoning.
* Reduce **hallucinations** (when AI makes things up).

### 🔹 Basic Example

**Bad Prompt:**

> Tell me about planets.

**Better Prompt:**

> Give me a short summary of the 8 planets in our solar system, listing each one with its key characteristics like size, atmosphere, and distance from the Sun.

**Output (example):**

* Mercury – smallest, no atmosphere
* Venus – dense CO₂ atmosphere, hottest planet
* Earth – supports life, water present
* Mars – thin atmosphere, red color due to iron oxide
* Jupiter – gas giant, largest planet
* Saturn – gas giant with visible rings
* Uranus – icy, tilted axis
* Neptune – cold, windy, farthest planet

The second prompt gives the AI **context, structure, and scope**, leading to a much more useful result.

### 🔹 Types of Prompting

#### 1. **Zero-shot Prompting**

No examples are given; you rely on the model’s general understanding.

> “Translate this sentence to French: I love learning AI.”

#### 2. **One-shot Prompting**

You give one example to guide the format.

> Example:
> English: Hello
> French: Bonjour
>
> Translate: How are you?

#### 3. **Few-shot Prompting**

You give a few examples to help the model learn the pattern.

> English: Good morning → French: Bonjour
> English: Thank you → French: Merci
> English: Goodbye → French: Au revoir
>
> Translate: See you later

#### 4. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

You ask the model to show its reasoning steps.

> “Explain your reasoning step by step: If there are 3 red apples and 2 green apples, how many apples in total?”

### 🔹 Example of Prompt Engineering for Coding

**Prompt:**

> Write a Python function to calculate factorial of a number. Add inline comments to explain each step.

**Better Prompt:**

> You are a Python expert. Write a clean, well-commented Python function that calculates the factorial of any given number using recursion. Include an example of how to call the function.

→ This gives context (“Python expert”), goal (factorial), method (recursion), and style (well-commented).

### 🔹 Prompt Engineering Techniques

* **Role prompting:** Assign a role or persona to the model (e.g., “You are a Linux administrator…”).
* **Contextual prompting:** Provide background info before asking.
* **Instruction chaining:** Break a large task into smaller steps.
* **Formatting control:** Ask for structured output like JSON, tables, or bullet points.
* **Negative prompting:** Tell the model what *not* to do (“Don’t explain, just give command syntax.”).

### 🔹 Summary

Prompt engineering is the art of **communicating clearly with AI models**.
You can think of it like programming in natural language — where your words are the code and the model’s response is the output.
Better prompts = better, more accurate, and more useful answers.
